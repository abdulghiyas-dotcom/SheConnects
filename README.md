# SheConnects

A Next.js site for SheConnects, a managed service studio powered by skilled Afghan women. The UI now uses a bright, pastel-inspired theme that emphasizes clarity and warmth.

## Bright theme highlights
- Soft radial gradient background and light card surfaces across the layout.
- Vibrant hero and CTA buttons with violet-to-fuchsia gradients for emphasis.
- Pastel gradient cards for services, process steps, testimonials, and contact form to keep sections cohesive.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Seeing this work on GitHub

If you do not see the bright-theme commits on GitHub yet, the repository likely does not have a remote configured. Add your GitHub repo as the `origin` remote and push the current branch:

```bash
git remote add origin <git@github.com:username/repo.git>
git push -u origin work
```

Replace the remote URL and branch name as needed (for example, push to `main` if that is your default branch). Once pushed, the commit history will appear on GitHub.
